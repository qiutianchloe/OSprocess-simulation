In this project, 

I used the shortest job first algorithm for cs.
In SJF,the process having the smallest execution time is chosen for the next execution.
It is helpful for batch-type processing.
Comparing to the round robin scheduler that I choose for the benchmark.
It reduce the overall waiting time for processes sets.
And making sure shorter jobs are executed first and finish without wasting time on loading ,hence have a short turnaround time. 
But when there is always new shorter processes keep comming, long job time processes will always keep wait. 

I used the Most Recently Used algorithm for cm. 
In LFU, the process with the lowest count is removed first. 
I compare it to the vm algorithm.More detail, our vm algorithm uses the Least Recently Used. 
In our case, all the processes executed one by one. Process A finish first, next round, A will still working at first. 
LRU always evict the process that most likely to execute. Hence increased lots of loading time. 
MRU works on the contract, so that decrease loading time,then have a short turnaround time
But in reality, the least recently used page is not likely run is reasonable. So MRU will be bad.
